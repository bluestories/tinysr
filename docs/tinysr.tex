TinySR is a light weight real-time small vocabulary speech recognizer written entirely in portable C.
The entire library fits in a single file (plus header file), and is under a single KLOC.
The primary goal of the project is to provide a clean, well documented teaching implementation of a basic Dynamic Time Warping recognizer.
As a secondary goal, a usable, small footprint recognizer is provided.
The entire project (all the code, training scripts, data and documentation) are released into the public domain, to maximize their pedagogical utility.
This document describes how TinySR works.
